          <h2>Welcome to my Midterm Exam project!</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I am pleased to present this project which is the result of my hard
            work and dedication in developing skills in HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. This project is also a testament to my success in
            completing the Midterm Exams. Through a deep understanding of
            programming languages and web design, I have created innovative and
            attractive solutions. In this project, I have applied concepts
            learned during my university days, such as using HTML for the basic
            structure of web pages, CSS for aesthetic appearance and layout, and
            JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. I hope that this project will
            reflect my progress and be the first step in my journey as a
            competent web developer.

                  Web development is the process of creating and maintaining
                  websites and web applications. It involves a combination of
                  programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the
                  front-end (user interface) and back-end (server-side logic)
                  components of a website. Front-end development focuses on
                  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the visual
                  elements and interactivity of a site, while back-end
                  development handles server-side programming using languages
                  like Python, Ruby, PHP, or JavaScript (Node.js) to handle data
                  storage, business logic, and integration with databases and
                  external APIs. Web development also encompasses tasks such as
                  testing, optimization, and deployment to ensure the website or
                  application runs smoothly across different devices and
                  browsers.

                <p>
                  Mobile app development is the process of creating software
                  applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and
                  tablets. It involves several stages, including ideation,
                  design, development, testing, and deployment. Developers use
                  programming languages and frameworks like Java, Swift, or
                  React Native to build apps for specific operating systems such
                  as iOS or Android. Key considerations in app development
                  include user experience (UX) design, functionality,
                  performance optimization, and security. Additionally, app
                  development may involve integrating features like push
                  notifications, in-app purchases, or social media sharing. Once
                  the app is developed, it goes through rigorous testing to
                  ensure its stability and usability. Finally, the app is
                  published to respective app stores, and developers often
                  provide updates and maintenance to improve the app over time.
